# ccSpigot
A paper fork that aims to prevent skylight lag and allow changing the server brand.
<br>
Don't say anything about those patches that have shit code! I don't know how to use git ROFL
# Config options
These options are in ccspigot.yml (we now have our own config!).

### disable-light-updates
Disable ALL light updates! This will prevent all the lag that comes from them. I haven't seen any issues in testing.
### server-brand
Change the server brand from Paper to whatever you want! This is shown on futureclient/in the f3 menu.

# Changes from paper
### Autosave
The autosave is now using paper's instead of bukkit by default. This is a lot better.
This will only be used if you delete your paper.yml AND your bukkit.yml before using.
